Codebook: Explanation of variables
----------------------------------

The following variables were used for organization in the study:

Subject - Integer assigned to each study participant
Activity - Factor with the following labels: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING 

The following variables were taken from wearables and fast fourier transformed:

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The variables in the tidy dataset are the averages for each subject/activity combination with the following function applied:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Variables in the dataset are a combination of FFT'd data suffixed with either 'Mean' to represent mean() or 'Std' to represent std()
